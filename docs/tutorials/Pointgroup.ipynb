The main focus in these tutorial is to learn how to perform the basic tasks in *Cosymlib* using it in the command-line mode. At the end we will give some examples on how to use it in an advanced mode by including calls to *Cosymlib's* functions in your own Python scripts. All important tasks can, however, be done in the command-line mode and this is the recommended option for users that just need to compute a CShM or CMS occasionally. In this case, all you need is a file with your structure and a call one of the basic commands of the Cosymlib, without any need to know anything about programming in Python. "

Eventually you may need to specify additional options that modify the behavior of the command. \n",
