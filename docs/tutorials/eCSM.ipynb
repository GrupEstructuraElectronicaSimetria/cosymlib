In the case of C2v the first axis corresponds to the C2 axis which is correctly located on the z axis. `esym` computes also the SOEVs, the symmetry operation expectation values $\\text{<}{\\rho}|R{\\rho}{>}$ for all operations R in C2v. Since all operations in C2v are actually symmetry operations for our molecule, the result is 1.000 in all cases. `esym` returns also the self similarity for the density, that is the value of $\\text{<}{\\rho}|E{\\rho}{>} = {<}{\\rho}|{\\rho}{>}$.\n",

    "`mosym` is the script used to analyze the symmetry of molecular orbitals. The SOEVs $\\text{<}{\\phi}|R{\\phi}{>}$ for molecular orbitals take values between -1 and 1 and it is not possible to calculate a simple CSM. In this case what we compute is their character with respect of a given irreducible representation of the group. In the case that the molecule has the full symmetry of the group, we will get a 100% character for one of the irreducible representations of the group and 0% for all other. If we don't have the full symmetry we will get intermediate values between 0 and 100% for each irreducible representation indicating the mixing of different symmetries. Since in `mosym` we don't compute the optimal orientation for the group, this must be provided in the call. Let's see an example with the water molecule. To make calculations shorter we will use just extended Hückel MOs, but the calculation can be done for the full electronic structure by reading an `.fchk` file.\n",
